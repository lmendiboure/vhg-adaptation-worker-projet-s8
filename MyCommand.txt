# "adaptation/mavideo.mp4" corresponds to the original file which will be processed
# "home/utilisateur/Documents/Projet/Resultats" corresponds to the output folder where will be found the results of the processing
# "11111" corresponds to the video ID which is used to create the descriptions' zips
# "" Corresponds to the List ID which will be send to the manager
# 50 corrresponds to the low bitrate, 1000 to the medium bitrate and 4500 to the high bitrate
# All these bitrates will be used to encode the video in different qualities
# 51 corresponds to the changeFrameRate in the description creator, it means that we are working with frames/GOP (depending of the value), here it is GOP
# 480 corresponds to the frame height of the descriptions, it will be used to compute the video resolution
# 5 corresponds to the number of descriptions, this number is used by the creator of descriptions
# "127.0.0.1" corresponds to the address of the manager, he will be informed at the end of the transcoding of a video
# 8081 corresponds to the port of the manager
# "api/manager/transco" corresponds to the End Point of the manager
